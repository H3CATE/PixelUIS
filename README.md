# PixelUIS

**PixelUIS** is a simple Magisk Module that replace the default ROM User Interface sounds located at /system/media/audio/ui with the UI sounds from the Google Pixel 2/2XL.

#Disclaimer

**This module was tested on the pocophone F1 and the OnePlus 3/3T. In theory it should work on every Android device.**
